## Cryptography
Converts data to unitelligible form.

**Q**: If cryptography is combined with compression, what is the right order?\
**A**: We should first compress first. This is because compression typically needs a pattern to reduce the message size; running a message through a crpyt-system will generate a random message that will be uncompressable.

### Cryptography vs Steganography
- Steganography concerns existence. It conceals the very existence of communication. In other words, it hides the secret message in plain sight.
