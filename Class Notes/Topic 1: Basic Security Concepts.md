### Security Objectives (CIA)
- **Confidentiality**: prevent and detect improper disclosure of information
- **Integrity**: prevent and detect improper modification of information
- **Availability**: prevent and detect improper denial of access to services provided by the system

### Security Mechanisms
- Prevention, ex. access control
- Detection, ex. auditing and intrusion detection
- Tolerance, ex. Byzantine agreement

### Security Services
Security functions are made available to users as a set of security services through APIs or integrated interfaces.
- **Confidentiality**: protection from information being exposed to unintended entities.
- **Authentication**: assurance that the origin of communication is authentic
- **Integrity**: assurance that the data has not been tampered with
- **Non-repudiation**: offer of evidence that a party is indeed the sender/receiver
- **Access control**: facilities to determine and enforce who is allowed access to what resources, host, software, and networks
- **Monitor and response**: facilities for monitoring security attacks, generating indications, surviving and recovering from attacks

### Security Assurance
Everyone wants high security assurance, but high assurance also means high cost.\
There must be a balance of **security**, **functionality**, and **ease-of-use**.

### Security by Obscurity (not reliable)
**Thinking**: "If we hide the inner workings of a system it will be secure."\
Sometimes not reliable because of widespread computer knowledge and expertise.\
More and more applications reveal their standards to the public, e.g. IEEE 802.11 and public key cryptography.

### Security by Legislation (not reliable)
**Thinking**: "If we instruct our users on how to behave, we can then secure our systems." e.g. users should not share passwords.\
Also not reliable. User awareness and cooperation is important, but cannot be the principal focus for achieving security.

### Threat and Attack Models
Threat and attack models need to be defined before a security mechanism is developed.

**Threat Model**:
- assumptions about the potential attackers
- describes attacker's capabilities

**Attack Model**:
- assumptions about attacks
- describe how attacks are launched
